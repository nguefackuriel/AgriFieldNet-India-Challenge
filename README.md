# AgriFieldNet-India-Challenge
Small farms (<2ha) produce about 35% of the worldâ€™s food, and are mostly found in low- and middle-income countries. Reliable information about these farms is limited, making support and policy-making difficult. Earth Observation data from satellites such as Sentinel-2, in combination with machine learning, can help improve agricultural monitoring, crop mapping, and disaster risk management for these small farms.

In this challenge, the goal is to classify crop types in agricultural fields across Northern India using multispectral observations from Sentinel-2 satellite. Fields are located in various districts in states of Uttar Pradesh, Rajasthan, Odisha and Bihar. The AgriFieldNet India training dataset is generated by the Radiant Earth Foundation, using the ground reference data collected and provided by IDinsight's Data on Demand team.
